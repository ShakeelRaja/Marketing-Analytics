# Marketing-Analytics
Marketing analysis using RFM analaysis, unsupervised clustering for automatic customer segmentation and apriori association mining. Kindly view the pdf file for detailed report on datasets, methods, experiments and results.

First experiment uses RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value) analysis for feature engineering which are then used with K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to automatically create customer segmentations. The code has been written in python and uses scikitlearn for machine learning.

The second experiment, conducted in R uses the original dataset for market basket analysis using association mining with Apriori algorithm. 

These experiments have been performed on an open dataset and the code can be modified with custome datasets containing similar variables. 

note: the provided code is not commented however it is pretty simple to follow.
